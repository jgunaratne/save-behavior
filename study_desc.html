	<h1>Retirement investment study</h1>
	<p>Thank you for participating in this retirement saving study conducted by researchers at New York University. This study simulates retirement investing over a 30 year period.</p>

	<p>For each year simulated in the study you are given a fictitous $5000 to invest. You have three choices of investments (also known as asset types): stocks, bonds and cash. You can choose to allocate your investments in any way you see fit.</p>

	<p>Here are the characteristics of the investments:</p>

	<table>
		<tr>
			<td>Asset type</td><td>Return</td><td>Volatility</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Stocks</td><td>8%</td><td>15%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Bonds</td><td>5%</td><td>5%</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Cash</td><td>0%</td><td>0%</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<table>
		<tr>
			<td>Asset type</td><td>Worse case</td><td>Likely case</td><td>Best case</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Stocks</td><td></td><td></td><td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Bonds</td><td></td><td></td><td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr> 
			<td>Cash</td><td></td><td></td><td></td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p>Please estimate the amount of money you will have at the end of the simulation:</p>
	<input type="text">

	<p>At the end of the 30 year simulation you will be shown the actual final amount of your investment.</p>

	<p>The closer your estimate is to the actual final amount the greater your Mechanical Turk reward. These are the rewards you may receive from Mechanical Turk for completing this study:</p>

<table>
	<tr><td>Estimate within 5% of final amount</td><td>$1.00</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Estimate within 15% of final amount</td><td>$0.50</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Estimate within 25% of final amount</td><td>$0.25</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Estimate within 50% of final amount</td><td>$0.10</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Estimate within 75% of final amount</td><td>$0.05</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Estimate very far off</td><td>no reward</td></tr>
